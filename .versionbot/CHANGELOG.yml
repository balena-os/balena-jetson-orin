    - subject: Update Poky to kirkstone HEAD
      hash: 8494d485d43c592bff25ee796955d3ab4445fb3c
      body: |
        We are maintaining a fork of Poky and using a branch there as source
        as we need to backport a bitbake patch that is still not contained
        in the current Yocto LTS release.

        The patch in question is:
        https://github.com/balena-os/poky/commit/debd42be214be6bce50a0f0a2fe186b20e6fe6bc

        This commit updates the branch to rebase that commit to the current
        kirkstone HEAD which includes security and bug fixes.

        The old branch is maintained not to loose history, and a new branch has
        been preferred over a merge into the current one as that would only
        bury the backported patch making it more difficult to follow what the
        reasoning for the branch is.

                        the function that was being used to fetch the DUT ip
                        from the worker had nested retries that led to 30x5 =
                        150 retries, and timeouts taking ~40 mins in the case
                        the DUT wasn't reachable (autokit setup fault, device
                        not booting, problem during flashing). This removes the
                        nested retries and reduces the retries to 50 /  ~ 10mins

      body: |
        During rollbacks we trigger the UEFI capsule update from l4T 35.5.0
        back to to L4T 35.4.1. The UEFI firmware does not allow this by default,
        so we patched it to accept downgrades when checking versions.

        However, the alternate slot may become unbootable in this process,
        as reported by the MB2 precompiled bootloader
        (see AGX Orin comments in HUP hook). In this case, we re-write the
        entire QSPI on the next HUP, and start off with a
        clean-flashed QSPI at the latest version 35.5.0.

        Apart from this we unload spi modules, to allow for future
        rollbacks from L4T 36.3 to be able to write the necessary
        UEFI variables necessary for triggering the rollback
        UEFI capsule update.

                When a ESR release is deployed a tag with the base meta-balena
                version

                is created. This is used by the API to check for a valid OS
                version

                for updates.


                The current mechanism to find the base version only provides an
                ESR

                version for the first commit after the branch has been created.


                Using merge-base to find the common ancestor and `tag
                --points-at` to

                find the actual tag works for all commits after the branch is
                created.

                Git describe does not include commit tags by default, and only
                annotated tags are shown.


                This behaviour was fine until a recent CI issue changed the
                types of tags used to version the repositories.


                This commit allows supporting of both types while the CI issue
                is investigated.

                The main variables measured into PCR7 to ensure secure boot
                configuration integrity are the state and EFI vars, including PK, KEK,
                db, dbx, etc.

                However, some systems have firmware that will measure other, unexpected
                events, such as "DMA Protection Disabled" (related to a Windows feature
                [0]), or "Unknown event type" with strange data.

                These events can't be predicted, and other devices may have different
                measured events that aren't compliant with the TCG spec, so attempt to
                check the TPM event log and extend our digest with any unknown events
                that fit the bill.

                When migrating the TPM2 policy used to secure the LUKS
                passphrase to use

                different PCRs, we temporarily want to maintain fallback
                capability in

                case the newly installed hostapp doesn't pass healthchecks. This
                allows

                the system to boot back into the original OS and try again.


                In order to do so, we leave the passphrase in place with the old
                PCR

                authentication policy. The cryptsetup hook in the initramfs will
                try

                PCRs 0,2,3,7 and if those don't work we fallback to the original
                PCRs.


                Once the new system successfully boots, we'll re-encrypt the
                passphrase

                and use the new PCRs to create a policy to secure the key.

                When encrypting the LUKS passphrase, we need the ability to
                construct a

                policy that can logically OR together multiple policies, such as
                when

                the machine may or may not measure binaries loaded through EFI
                boot

                services into PCR7.


                We also need the ability to update the sealing policy to revoke

                previously valid configurations, such as after
                hostapp-healthcheck

                completes successfully. Ideally, this should be completed before

                modifying any efi variables, to prevent the system from becoming

                unbootable in the event of an interrupted update.


                These requirements necessitate the ability to create sealing
                policies

                and authenticate against them outside of the
                hw_{en,de}crypt_passphrase

                functions.


                This commit allows the caller to setup the sealing policy when

                encrypting, and choose what kind of authentication to use when

                decrypting.

                string we

                can match against.

                Generate hash for second stage bootloader and enroll in db
                efivar to

                allow the firmware to verify the image for booting when using
                EFISTUB.


                This is necessary to update to GRUB 2.12, which passes the EFI
                image to

                the EFI boot services LoadImage method, which then validates the
                image

                when secure boot is enabled.

              hash: 374c4c32df59cc00e0b04d0c619f6fb98a69f1a5
              body: >
                The dispatcher script that moves around FORWARD rules of shared

                interfaces currently calls iptables assuming it will always work

                but in practice two iptables commands can not run in parallel

                and we have occasionally seen the script fail with:


                Another app is currently holding the xtables lock.

                Perhaps you want to use the -w option?


                This patch adds the -w option to make the script wait for the
                lock

                when necessary.


                It also makes the script exit with an error code if anything
                fails,

                which will log the output as WARN instead of INFO as the errors

                are easy to overlook at this moment.

                We don't need any iptables features in order to perform

                hostapp-update in this build recipe, and it has no impact

                on build output.


                It does, however, improve compatbility with build environments
                and

                reduces the dependencies of the build host kernel.

                The supervisor will now write the following dtoverlay setting

                "gpio-key,gpio=4,active_low=0,gpio_pull=down"

                So we need to rework the test to account for these changes.

                a203bcdfd567c0cc4b4ed9de493513142cd7463f introduced a dependency

                on /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults to hostapp-update-hooks,
                however

                during HUP the script is not only executed in the "new" OS
                container

                but directly in the context of the "old" OS as well, so

                /usr/sbin/balena-config-defaults needs to exist there.

                The file was introduced in balenaOS v2.99.28, so trying to HUP

                from anything before that will fail.


                This patch changes this to a soft dependency so even if the file

                is missing HUP will continue.

                At this moment resin_update_state_probe looks for the root
                partition

                by UUID and assumes that only a single device is returned. This

                assumption breaks when the root is on a MD RAID1 device as not
                only

                the virtual MD device holds a filesystem with the given UUID,

                each member does as well.


                This patch makes resin_update_state_probe ignore devices

                that are RAID members which in that case will only return

                the MD device as expected.

                Yocto already splits the build sstate by target arch, native
                arch, toolchains, and machine where applicable.


                Keeping the caches separated by device type prevents sharing of
                common cache steps between identical toolchains and
                architectures.

                Currently devices with on-board storage fail to build in jenkins, if they don't provide a flasher image. One example is the CM4. Since there are multiple devices using this configuration, let's re-enable builds for all of them.

                        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both
                        lines as

                        belonging to the same overlay, preventing users from
                        configuring multiple

                        devices, and leading to a loop when trying to apply
                        configurations with

                        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

                        Rsync (v2) deltas have been broken since [Supervisor v14](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/commit/460c3ba0aab31d18a02e3f5dda1838691768c494). While considered legacy,
                        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
                        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can
                        completely remove rsync deltas from the supervisor

                      hash: e22253ce6ebc40e865b5bc26844901026f04ec4e
                      body: >
                        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend
                        was omitting

                        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus
                        resulting in the SV

                        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been
                        applied, since gpio

                        would not be in current config.txt config but would be
                        in target config.

                        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of
                        attempting to apply the

                        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

                      hash: 6e6a796da5ecc846248eae4c8495bc626964c038

                        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
                        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
                        if they are not used by other overlays.
                        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
                        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
                        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
                        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
                        provisioning config.txt as variables.

                        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
                        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
                        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
                        relative ordering

                        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the
                        order that they

                        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last
                        dtoverlay defined on the

                        file, or to the base overlay.


                        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this
                        ordering, and it

                        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they
                        cannot be

                        overriden by later overlays.


                        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is
                        possible that existing

                        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the
                        parser. If

                        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target
                        state which

                        will cause the device to reboot.

      hash: ccaef5fabbf836ac126e3b2c6778e035105b5a3f
      body: |
        Adds a custom DTB that enables the SPI pins in the 40-pin header of the
        Jetson AGX Orin Dev Kit. The 40-pin header defaults to GPIO. This DTB
        was generated using the jetson-io utility that is supplied with L4T and
        JetPack to configure the 40-pin header. The DTB has been verified by
        uploading to balenaOS devices and using the device configuration in
        balenaCloud.

                During HUP, rollback-health-breadcrumb and
                rollback-altboot-breadcrumb

                are created in the state partition to trigger rollback-health
                and

                rollback-altboot respectively on the next boot. After these
                services

                complete, they will remove these breadcrumbs.


                Make the broken init fallback tests wait for these services to
                become

                inactive before testing the state of the breadcrumbs. Otherwise,
                a race

                condition can make these tests fail. Most notably on slower
                systems,

                such as emulated generic-aarch64.

                Without this dependency, the call to `jq` does not happen and
                the check

                for INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL is not performed.


                Several devices that define internal storage but do not define

                INTERNAL_DEVICE_KERNEL will now fail and need to be fixed.

            - subject: "balena-image-bootloader-initramfs.bb: Add fsck module"
              hash: 4b1bc7244ab21a9952ea7569c0c0e1bc9a11e2e0
              body: >
                The balena bootloader initramfs contains the rootfs module and
                that

                will get the rootfs mounted but not checked first for errors.
                This is

                problematic because at first boot with network connectivity
                available,

                time will sync but the rootfs will still have the last mount
                time in

                1970. If at that point the rootfs gets corrupted then at next
                boot

                the rootfs' initramfs module from balena-bootloader will try to
                mount

                the rootfs without checking it first and then after that the
                filesystem

                check triggered by the fsck module from the actual kernel
                initramfs will

                fail like this:


                [init][INFO] Running filesystem checks on partition resin-rootA
                (/dev/disk/by-state/resin-rootA)

                resin-rootA contains a file system with errors, check forced.

                resin-rootA: Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked
                list found.


                resin-rootA: UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENCY; RUN fsck MANUALLY.
                        (i.e., without -a or -p options)

                This commit will add the fsck module to balena bootloader's
                initramfs

                which will trigger filesystem checks before the rootfs module
                runs.

                This fixes rollback-health failures for boards like the Jetson
                Seeeed

                J4012, which updates efivars for capsule updates from container
                hooks

                and not from the current OS hooks.


                While the actual HUP works because of /sys being bindmounted by

                hostapp-update, rollbacks will fail to run the old OS hooks
                unless

                efivarfs is mounted.

                        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to
                        the Config field,

                        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from
                        settling as the

                        current state never matches the target state (empty mac
                        address). This

                        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in
                        moby/moby#47228


                        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine
                        is updated, and this

                        change fixes testing for now.

                        This would cause

                        the docker utils test to fail since the network/subnet

                        prettierrc will allow formatting to work correctly with

                The class will perform a basic configuration of a linux kernel

                to be used as the balena bootloader. Device types are expected

                to inherit it and perform additional device-specific
                configuration.

                The kexec initrd script currently removes the maxcpus=0 kernel
                arg

                which we use to put the system into non-SMP mode. This however
                does

                not work on all platforms and nr_cpus=1 seems to be a more
                robust

                solution, so with this patch nr_cpus will be removed as well.

                chain"
              hash: 089f4d639383a4981d4840f9e22cccc97270b339
              body: >
                At this moment there is a race condition between NetworkManager

                and the engine when a shared interface is configured. If the
                interface

                is configured first and the engine second, the containers are
                allowed

                to access DHCP hosts behind the shared interface. If the engine
                comes

                up first and the shared interface second, access will be denied.


                This patch adds a dispatcher script that always configures the
                firewall

                rules as if the engine came up last. This does not really
                address

                the underlying issue but it overcomes the race condition and
                makes

                the behavior deterministic, which is good enough at this point.

                We've noticed that leaving the host discoverable indefinitely on
                Pi3 Autokit hosts solves sporadic scan failures. Thus, leaving
                the host discoverable for 20 minutes should be sufficient to
                prevent these cases.

                      hash: 3ea8d4727a4f4b068b308d1f407b7cf0dae2733b

                        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match
                        the target

                        release when the service doesn't change between
                        releases. We have seen

                        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to
                        relate to the

                        engine keeping stale references after container
                        restarts. The only way

                        around this issue is to remove the old container and
                        create it again.

                        This implements that workaround during the
                        updateMetadata step to deal

                        with that issue.

                If hyperlinks are unquoted, a target=blank is added and entire
                link is broken in the dashboard. This doesn't happen for devices
                which use quoted links, like for example the CM4.

                There have been reports of an empty config vars cache file -
                probably

                because of a race condition when the reading of config.json
                happens just

                as the file is being replaced.


                Add some checks and retries to avoid this errors from happening.

              hash: 0f3bd475dadc52aa48f7b98bf18e4cd3a1b9e9e7
              body: |
                The log files are kept in the /run partition that also houses
                the udev database.

                By moving the /run partition to $ROOTFS_DIR/run in the migrate
                module, the udev database persists across reboots.

                The udevcleanup module was introduced to cleanup the database
                so it's regenerated on the final rootfs as the rules are
                different between initramfs and final rootfs. By moving /run
                before udevcleanup ran, the cleanup was not effective.

                This commit moves the relocation of the /run mount to the
                finish module, after udevcleanup is run, and groups it with
                the other relocations needed for the pivot switch.

                Looking at git history, the relocation of the /run partition
                was initially done in the rootfs module, so when the migrate
                module was introduced and needed to mount the rootfs, this
                relocation was just moved into the migration module itself,
                without considering later modules like finish.

                This provides an easy switch to enable tracing on HUP hooks that
                works

                both on old and new OS hooks as enabling it depends on a
                config.json

                setting.


                It is meant to debug field issues with HUP failure where all we
                see is:

                ```

                Before hooks (old os) ran successfully

                Failed to run the new hooks. Running current hooks..

                ```

                For example:

                Detecting whether the script is running in a PID namespace by
                checking

                `/proc/1/sched` does not work for newer kernels

                (see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17917).


                Properly detecting this is too cumbersome for a bash logging
                script,

                see https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/17902, however,
                falling

                back to the last check, that is, seeing if `/.dockerenv` exists
                is easy

                enough and works for our use case.


                This script will only be called from the hostOS, and the only
                case it is

                called from a container is during HUP and the container is
                always a hostOS

                image. So even though the interface chosen by moby, a file under
                /,

                is a bad interface in general, it works fine for the specific
                limitations

                of balenaOS.


                Also, check for `/run/.containerenv` which is the equivalent
                interface

                for podman for future proofing.

                        Whenever the Supervisor reports current state, it diffs
                        the current state

                        with its last reported current state. However, when the
                        Supervisor starts

                        up, there is no last reported state, since that last
                        report is stored in

                        process memory. Caching the last report in a location
                        that survives

                        Supervisor restarts will reduce the current report
                        bandwidth used on startup.

                We add a script which can be replaced by device repositories
                to implement device-specific healthchecks. One usecase for this
                test is the Jetson UEFI firmware update check,
                but can be extended to all other devices as needed.

                We previously tried to use a single time limit for the execution
                of the

                healthcheck test on all device types. This was causing
                occasional false

                positives in our Continuous Integration pipeline, though --
                especially

                on slow devices like Pi Zeros and the generic-aarch64, which
                runs on

                emulated hardware.


                This commit addresses this issue, this commit:


                1. Limits execution for device types for which we have collected
                enough
                   data to have a good idea of how long the test should take.
                2. Uses time limits specific for each device type.

                        PR #2217 removed the expose configuration but also
                        caused a regresion

                        where ports set via the `ports` configuration would no
                        longer get

                        exposed to the host, despite portmappings being set.
                        This fixes that

                        issue by exposing only those ports comming from port
                        mappings.

                        The docker EXPOSE directive and corresponding
                        docker-compose `expose`

                        service configuration serves as documentation/metadata
                        that a container

                        listens on a certain port that may be used for service
                        discovery but it doesn't

                        have any real impact on the ability for

                        other containers on the same network to access the
                        exposed service via

                        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property
                        may conflict

                        with other network configurations, and prevent the
                        container from being

                        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


                        This PR removes code that would manage the expose
                        property and takes the

                        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the
                        `expose` property

                        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or
                        unknown compose fields: expose`.


                        While this change should not have operational impact, it
                        still removes

                        a previously supported configuration and as such there
                        is a chance of it

                        being a breaking change for some applications. For this
                        reason it is

                        being published as a new major version.

                The code moved from meta-balena-kirkstone was not really
                specific to

                kirkstone so let's move it here so that future branches for
                newer yocto

                releases which we'll base off kirkstone don't continue to add
                this

                unneeded  duplication.

                There are other meta-balena-* directories that still contain the

                duplication we moved from meta-balena-kirkstone but we're not
                really

                concerned with that because going forward those old directories
                will

                naturally get deprecated.

                If the target supervisor image is already cached but there is no

                container running with it, the update script would just exit
                without

                actually running the target supervisor.


                This commit checks whether there is a running container using
                the

                target image and restarts the supervisor if there is none.

    - subject: Update battery backed RTC from system clock on the Orin AGX
      hash: 2d3f73c04c3073d220d906a9c4591e5b7c535a8c
      body: |
        Commit 336d198b079a03941344410806bb449b90b4dbe2 switched the source RTC
        device for system clock from rtc1 (on the SoM) to rtc0 (on the carrier
        board, battery-backed).

        This only solves half of the problem as it will correctly use rtc0
        as the clock source on boot (controlled by CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS_DEVICE),
        but chrony will still periodically write system time to rtc1
        (controlled by CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE), meaning rtc0 is in fact
        never set correctly.

        This patch configures CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC_DEVICE to also use rtc0.

                We now have several places where secure boot specific
                configuration is

                checked. Create an os-helpers-secureboot package to consolidate
                and

                reuse this code.

                This flag isn't needed on balenaOS as the splash screen
                remains even after plymouthd is stopped.

                Having the flag in place prevents user apps from writing to
                tty consoles after stopping plymouth via dbus.

                        0c7bad779291e15e419166a2c66c2a21dd06aa83, as that

                        change causes a service restart loop. The supervisor
                        cannot distinguish

                        between ports exposed via the `EXPOSE` directive and the
                        docker-compose

                        `expose` property. Because of this, in the case of
                        `network-mode:

                        service:<...>` the current state and target state never
                        match, leading

                        to a service restart loop.

                        The supervisor exposes ports configured using the
                        `EXPOSE` directive in

                        the dockerfile when configuring the container for
                        runtime. This can

                        cause issues if using `network_mode: service:<service
                        name>` as the

                        expose configuration is not compatible with that network
                        mode. This

                        fix now skips image exposed ports for that particular
                        network mode.

              hash: 3d99028daf1f9bfb0513f4e0702f3863aed3a205
              body: >
                When searching for devices matching the glob list in

                get_internal_device(), a glob match breaks from a nested loop
                rather

                than the parent loop, allowing the function to output multiple
                matches.


                When running the flasher, this results in the script failing
                with an

                incorrect path to the internal disk.


                Break from the parent loop to fix this behavior.

                This is done by the bootloader (uboot/grub) at this moment but
                as we

                are moving towards the balena 2nd stage bootloader, it needs to
                be

                moved into the initramfs.


                This adds a standalone recipe - by default yocto tries to build
                all

                modules defined in the initramfs-framework recipe, which breaks

                on armv7 when abroot is defined there. This is because it
                depends

                on grub-editenv which is not supported on armv7.

                The rootfs script uses both os-helpers-fs and os-helpers-logging

                though the package depends on neither. This seems to work now
                because

                in most cases something else pulls in the dependencies or the
                code

                on a particular device does not fall under the branches that use

                the missing functions.

      body: >
        The Orin AGX devkit has two RTC clocks, one in the SOM and one in the

        carrier board. The BSP defaults to using the one in the SOM but only

        the one in the carrier board is connected to a backup battery and is
        able

        to keep time between reboots.

                The hostapp-update hooks for UEFI capsule updates
                need to create and update the contents of some platform
                specific efi variables inside the /sys directory, and thus
                we need to bindmount this directory in the hostapp-update
                script for internal testing, as well as in balenahup for
                api triggered updates.

              hash: 0b246409da5359741138a81b552fcc6bb3ecc24e
              body: >
                314047e and b5c5214 made flasher block until the
                resin-device-register

                service exits and made resin-device-register give up after 6
                seconds

                not to block infinitely when no network is available. This
                effectively

                means that if the device fails to register within first 6
                seconds,

                it will never retry, flasher will not report status to the
                dashboard

                and the device will only register on first boot.


                This patch changes the logic back to resin-device-register
                trying

                in the background in an infinite loop and moves the "give the
                device

                a chance to register" delay to flasher itself. It also extends

                the wait to openvpn as flasher already does that and wants VPN
                to run

                to be debuggable - in case flashing fails, it would be possible

                to SSH in via the VPN and look at the logs remotely.

                The kernel-balena class contains:

                CONIFG_SECURITY=n


                which is mispelled and not being applied. The commit where this
                was

                introduced claims it's needed to completely disable the audit
                logs, and

                also that the security framework is unused.


                I disagree in that it's unused - the hostOS is not using any
                security

                framework, but applications may, so luckily the security
                framework was

                never disabled.


                Removing this mispelled entry should have no functional effect.
                Whether

                the audit subsystem is disabled will depend on the final kernel

                configuration. Definitely we have not seen a need to disable it
                recently,

                and we have not seen the kernel log flooded with messages.


                I'd argue the disabling of the audit subsystem in meta-balena
                serves no

                need but I also have no specific reason to remove it at the
                moment.

                At this moment grub.cfg sources /grub/grub_extraenv which works
                fine

                on MBR systems, however on EFI systems this does not work
                because GRUB

                is installed in /EFI/BOOT/ rather than /grub/.


                This patch replaces the hardcoded /grub with ${prefix} which
                should

                expand to the appropriate directory regardless of the platform.
                It also

                removes the loading of grub_extraenv from the secure boot
                variant

                of the GRUB config since this would not load without a signature
                anyway.

    - subject: "hostapp-update-hooks: Move efivars trigger to 'after' hook"
      hash: 930c6b8c4abab1c7db7133b5cf29a590aa1d5fe5
      body: >
        In PR https://github.com/balena-os/balena-jetson-orin/pull/238

        we added the prebuilt capsule binaries as well as the legacy

        bundle for L4T 35.3.1, and we also added the switch of the esp

        and resin-boot partition types - which is performed if resin-boot

        does not have the esp,boot flags set by the flashing tools. These

        flags are needed by the UEFI firmware to load the capsule from

        the resin-boot partition, and we'll modify jetson-flash to set

        them during provisioning from now on.


        The uefi variable setting approach in the above PR won't work

        as-is because balenaHUP does not run hostapp-update in a container,

        and because the existing hostapp-update script in the current releases

        does not bindmount the sysfs directory. Thus it doesn't allow for the

        efivars needed to trigger the capsule update to be written.


        The approach we want to take further and implement here is:

          - use legacy update if updating from a very old release which
            does not support capsule update
          - trigger the capsule update from the after hook - which runs in
            the current OS - until a release with an update hostapp-update
            script becomes available in production for the AGX orin. See
            meta-balena PR #3194
          - once a release that bindmounts sysfs is available, we'll switch
            to using the legacy mode for any releases that don't have the new
            hostapp-update script, and remove the capsule update from the after hook

        The advantage of the above approach is that we create an update path

        that is a bit faster and safer than the legacy update mode, until a

        newer hostapp-update script is available in production images.

                The SIM7600G modem will fail to connect using
                QMI and the default 45s timeout, nor will it work
                with a 65s one. The value we found to work consistently
                with this modem connected over pcie is 95s.

                The imx8mm-var-dart-plt also uses a custom implementation
                for detecting the boot switch, so let's make use of the
                existing support in meta-balena for the testbot provisioning
                use-case and add this DT in the Autokit.

                GitHub App installation tokens are short-lived and do not
                need to be rotated the same way PATs do.

                The default app ID and installation ID correspond to
                flowzone-bot[app] installed in the balena-os Org.

                cryptsetup lazily depends on libgcc. With libgcc missing,
                certain

                operations, especially luksOpen will fail with

                `libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_exit to work`

                which panics the kernel and triggers a reboot loop
                indistinguishable

                from a "device has been tampered with" state on regular builds

                with no console output.

    - subject: "tegra-binaries: Update Orin NVME boot blob after partition size change"
      hash: 46605d76820ec1b848c41efcce3037a158046bd7
      body: |
        At this point the Orin Nano is not deployed to production,
        so the partition update done previously to fix the zip
        file size problem doesn't cause any problem.

        We updated the boot blob however because it's not currently
        possible to test a UEFI triggered bootloader update - the BSP
        doesn't provide one yet.

        Previous sizes caused the image to have more than 4GB,
        which is the maximum allowed size for a file contained
        in a zip archive. This causes problem for the image maker.

                Kexec is used to boot into the decrypted kernel in the hostapp
                on

                systems with secure boot and full-disk encryption.


                If kexec fails, we don't want to continue with the rest of the
                boot

                process in the first stage kernel, so bail out on failure.

                Adapted as a bbappend from:
                https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/commit/meta/recipes-kernel/linux/kernel-devsrc.bb?id=2be1b5d7d38d72c35ec593b98366d128fe5ce12c

                The 6.1 kernel has a number of Kbuild and architecture changes
                that required us to update our devsrc recipe. With these changes
                we are once again able to build on target modules for all
                supported archectures.

                        It's not an official status from container inspects, and
                        the Supervisor

                        doesn't set it internally anywhere. It's better to
                        remove it entirely as the

                        method by which Supervisor sets internal service
                        statuses is by using a global

                        event emitter (reportNewStatus) which makes things
                        difficult to test.

                We have seen devices that won't change PCR1 hash when a
                temporary boot

                order override was applied or secure boot was disabled via BIOS
                setup.

                The implementation of what PCR1 actually measures is very

                device-specific, but many of the risks can be mitigated by
                setting up

                a BIOS password and disabling F-key shortcuts for interacting
                with

                the firmware.

              body: >
                Both `kernel-modules-headers` and `kernel-devsrc` provide kernel
                headers

                since Yocto Thud switched `kernel-devsrc` from full source to
                just

                kernel headers.


                The only difference between them is that
                `kernel-modules-headers` builds

                some target binaries which need to be built with `make
                modules_prepare`

                when using `kernel-devsrc` headers. These binaries depend on
                libc version

                matching though so they have shown to be problematic.


                This commit removes the `kernel-modules-headers` recipe and
                modifies

                `kernel-devsrc` to replace it. The deployed artifact remains
                named as

                `kernel-modules-headers` as it's a more descriptive name.


                This introduces a breaking change in the balenaOS API as
                customers that

                are using `kernel-modules-headers` to build external kernel
                modules will

                now need to issue a `make modules_prepare` as part of their
                build scripts.

                After switching to LUKS2, the header size increased from 2MB to
                16MB.

                While HUP of older systems works, it is impossible to provision

                new encrypted systems.


                This patch fixes the header size in flasher.

                        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the
                        container status was too general,

                        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a
                        container would have a status of

                        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to
                        be untrue, as manually stopped

                        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor
                        due to their inspect status of

                        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became
                        unavoidable as there are no other

                        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually
                        stopped and shouldn't be started

                        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race
                        condition issue (again, see #2170).


                        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we
                        don't need to worry about different behaviors

                        amongst restart policies, as any container with the
                        error message on exit should be started.

                        Previously, `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()` would
                        incorrectly return

                        an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` if the last read from the
                        second concatenated

                        `Reader` didn't completely fill the passed buffer.


                        For instance:


                        ```
                              First Reader    Second Reader
                            |aaaaaaaaaaaaa|bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb|      <--- concatReadSeekCloser
                            |--- previously read ---|--- buffer ---| <--- last read
                                                              |xxxx| <--- "excess" buffer
                        ```


                        In this example, we have a `concatReadSeekCloser` that
                        concatenates two

                        `Reader`s (`aaa...` and `bbb...`). The last `Read()`
                        used a buffer

                        larger than the yet-to-be-read portion of the `bbb...`.
                        So, it would

                        incorrectly return an `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.


                        This commit makes sure that last `Read()` returns all
                        the remaining data

                        without an error. It also adds various test cases for

                        `concatReadSeekCloser.Read()`, many of which would fail
                        before this

                        correction.


                        Interestingly, this bug was silently affecting us. Not
                        in a fatal way,

                        but causing deltas to be larger than necessary. Indeed,
                        running

                        `TestDeltaSize` after this commit shows that some test
                        cases are

                        producing deltas smaller than what we expected before.
                        For posterity,

                        see all the details below.


                        We use `concatReadSeekCloser`s to concatenate all layers
                        of the basis

                        image when creating the "signature" of the basis image.
                        In this process,

                        the `concatReadSeekCloser`s are wrapped around by a
                        buffered reader with

                        a buffer of 65kB.


                        If, in any read, part of this 65kB buffer was beyond the
                        second

                        concatenated reader, it would result in an
                        `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`. This

                        would not cause the whole process to fail, but would
                        prematurely end the

                        signature generation: some of the final blocks in the
                        basis image would

                        not be added to the signature. Therefore, if those
                        blocks appeared in

                        the target image, they'd result in (larger) LITERAL,
                        instead of

                        (smaller) COPY operations.


                        For illustration, here's the delta generated for the
                        `delta-006-008`

                        test case. First before this commit:

                        That 21kB LITERAL is the difference in size we saw in
                        the test results.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                This should be the default but with no explicit argument we
                still

                end up with LUKS1 partitions. This patch adds the parameter to
                enforce

                LUKS2 formatting and adds conversion to LUKS2 to the cryptsetup

                initrd script.

                This helper command saves and compares crc32 sum for a memory
                area where the kernel image or the device-tree is loaded.

                Can be used after loading the kernel and the dtb, and also prior
                to calling booti.

                        restart policy
                      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
                      body: >
                        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host
                        resource that may not

                        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a
                        container's compose config

                        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as
                        a network interface, and the

                        Engine tries to create & start the container before the
                        host resource is created, the

                        Engine will not reattempt to start the container,
                        regardless of the restart policy.

                        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the
                        behavior as implemented by Docker.


                        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a
                        grace period of 1 minute

                        after starting a container to see that the container's
                        status has become 'running`.

                        If the container exits because of the race condition,
                        the status becomes 'exited' and the

                        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step.
                        This noop-wait-start step loop

                        will repeat until the container is able to start.


                        If the container is never able to start, there was a
                        problem in the host in the creation of the

                        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host
                        level.


                        This commit does not handle the case of services with
                        restart policies "no" or "on-failure"

                        which encounter this host race, as metadata from
                        container inspects needs to be introduced

                        during step calculation in order to figure out whether
                        services with those restart policies

                        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

                When running in the initramfs, the resin-device-progress package
                is not

                installed as we cannot guarantee that the initramfs would be
                able to

                bring up all types of network interfaces.


                This commit adds a check for the script to exists instead of
                getting a

                `command not found` when an API endpoint is defined.

                The purpose of testing the API calls is to detect breaking
                changes, not

                to fail builds because of temporary network or API access
                problems.


                Printing a warning instead should be enough for developers to
                detect

                breaking changes.

                        Support for colon characters was added v14.6.0 which
                        enabled

                        configurations for HDMI port 2 (e.g on the RPi 4). These
                        configurations

                        are not documented anywhere else so this allows users to
                        be able to

                        better find the relevant information for working with
                        HDMI.

                When programming keys for secure boot, some devices do not clear

                the setup mode flag after a new PK is installed. In this case

                flasher will reboot in order to ensure the keys are actually
                saved

                and the device comes back with secure boot enabled. Since we
                changed

                flasher to be unsigned by default, this reboot causes a security

                violation.


                With this patch flasher will add a new boot entry before issuing

                the reboot so that signed flasher comes up and the installation
                process

                can continue.

                Currently the db.auth file is signed as "append" in order to
                make HUP work.

                Most UEFI firmwares will accept such file even for "replace",
                which we do

                during the initial provisioning, however we have seen devices
                that will

                only allow appending, which makes flasher fail.


                With this patch flasher will use the esl file for initial
                programming

                of the db variable.


                PK and KEK are unaffected.

                        Previously, we'd time-out a pull operation after
                        unsuccessfully retrying

                        for about 17 minutes (for details see commit

                        582487f832c59c2f734a780ab0492833f29002c9). This worked
                        fine in most

                        situations, but we have seen at least one case of a
                        particularly

                        unreliable network connection that would not be able to
                        finish a large

                        pull when operating under this policy.


                        This commit:


                        * Completely removes timeouts from image pulls. We'll
                        keep retrying
                          forever, or until users cancel the pull. (From the perspective of the
                          REST API, "canceling" mean closing the HTTP connection. This is what
                          happens when a user Ctrl+C during a pull in the CLI, or, say, we kill
                          a curl process that was using the REST API to pull image.)
                        * Still uses exponential back-off, but we now limit the
                        interval between
                          retries to 5 minutes. The rationale is that some very unreliable
                          networks may be up only for relatively small time windows. Therefore,
                          using intervals that are too long would increase the risk of missing
                          these windows.
                        * Tries to avoid flooding the log stream with messages
                        about retries.
                          We'll log every retry attempt up to the 10th. After that, we'll log
                          retries only once about every 2h. This retry count is reset every time
                          we successfully download any amount of data.

                        With the current QEMU setting, `installerForceMigration`
                        alone is not

                        enough and the QEMU_INTERNAL_STORAGE also needs to be

                        the worker's environment so only a single external disk
                        is attached to

                        the emulator.

                        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be
                        on the same

                        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being
                        detected

                        correctly. This is because the assumption that the
                        parent block device

                        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does
                        not work

                        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be
                        /dev/mapper/luks-XXX

                        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g.
                        /dev/sda.


                        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two -
                        boot and efi.

                        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is
                        encrypted and the efi

                        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.


                        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent
                        device so that

                        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

                        For this reason we now create a separate service to run
                        the built

                        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests

                This patch adds a wait4file loop to the script that waits

                for the /dev/disk/by-state directory. This is not tied to any
                particular

                partition or device but since the directory does not exist by
                default

                and is only created by a custom balenaOS udev rule, its
                existence

                implies that the rule fired and a device with balenaOS
                partitions

                is present in the system.

        The built-in tegra-xudc driver crashes on altboot from
        35.2.1 to 35.1.0 as it isn't compatible with the newer firmware,
        leaving the board in an inconsistent state.

        We thus blacklist and disable tegra-xudc and disable all potential
        calls to its' functions from the usb gadget driver, which could cause
        altboot to fail.

                        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device
                        already running

                        a service from a new release with network changes would
                        never stop the

                        running service so remaining services would forever get
                        stuck in

                        `Downloaded` state.


                        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed
                        in this case,

                        particularly allowing devices to recover from #1576

                        services in the `Downloaded` state, because the state

                        network and a container change.

                A safe copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw
                also and that is

                not the case for boot files. Still, some file like `config.json`
                would

                benefit from a safe copy so we still try that first.


                Fixes #2998

                If a safe copy is preferred but non-critical, the unsafe fatrw
                command

                can be used and if fatrw does not have enough resources to make
                a safe

                copy it will fallback to a standard cp.


                This is useful when performing hostOS updates for example where
                a safe

                copy would only work for files that are read by fatrw also and
                that is

                        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to
                        the state

                        engine.


                        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target
                        state and passes
                          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
                          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
                          the app.

                        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing
                        only the
                          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
                          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

                        There were multiple places in the state engine that
                        skipped some

                        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's
                        needed while in

                        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.


                        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose
                        app to be more

                        local mode agnostic and instead making the image
                        deletion and volume

                        deletion configurable via function arguments.


                        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local
                        mode

                        applications more similar to cloud mode applications,
                        allowing for

                        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

                When parsing additional variables to be passed to the bitbake
                build,

                keys and values are split using equals as a delimiter. However,
                the

                splitting process does not split only on the first occurrence,
                which

                results in removing equals signs from the value as well. This is

                problematic with base64 encoded strings, which are padded with
                equals

                signs.


                Split only on the first occurrence, leaving the value intact.

              body: >
                This patch changes the validation of bootable images from
                certificate

                signatures to a list of allowed hashes of binaries. This only
                applies

                on db level, PK and KEK are still certificates.


                The motivation is that certificates expire and we need to be
                sure

                that even devices that have been lying on a shelf for several
                years

                or whose CMOS battery has died and reset date to 1970-01-01 are
                still

                bootable. Using hashes is more aligned with this use-case and
                also

                more similar to the approach that embedded SoCs use.

              body: >
                Shipping a single image with signature checks enabled will
                enforce

                the signatures on non-secure-boot systems as well. GRUB does not
                have

                a simple method to check whether secure boot is enabled that
                could

                be embedded with the default built-in config.


                With this patch we build two separate images - one enforcing

                the signatures and the other one not, keeping the original
                behavior.

                HUP and flasher both can detect if secure boot is enabled so
                they

                put the correct image in place when installing/updating GRUB.

                        Node 15 [changed the way it treats unhandled promise rejections](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V15.md#throw-on-unhandled-rejections---33021) from a warning to a throw.
                        For this reason errors like a corrupt migration directory, that happens when trying to
                        roll back to a previous supervisor version were no longer showing a
                        message but dumping the full minimized code into the journal logs.

                        This PR adds a catchall on app.ts to log the exception and throw an exit
                        code of 1.

                        Restart-service checks that both services have restarted in its test assertion, which is
                        incorrect as restart-service should only restart one service.

                    - subject: Mount boot partition into container on Supervisor start
                      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
                      body: >
                        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has
                        access to host /dev, and therefore has access

                        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This
                        commit sets up the framework for the following:


                        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each
                        partition based on partition label

                        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the
                        device

                        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided
                        by host's start-balena-supervisor script

                        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these
                        queries through methods in lib/host-utils.ts


                        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot
                        partition.


                        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container
                        `run` arguments provided by a host script,

                        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to
                        start itself (Supervisor-as-an-app).

                        Notable improvements these new versions bring:


                        * Optimized code path for generating deltas with blocks
                        that are
                          power-of-two-sized.
                        * Avoid allocating unbounded amounts of memory when the
                        target differs
                          completely from the source.
                        * Several bugfixes in edge cases that shall not affect
                        balenaEngine.

        perhaps the image is too large. Let's shrink the
        partition sizes a bit to investigate the root cause.

        The image-maker appears to fail in staging,
        perhaps the image is too large. Let's shrink the
        partition sizes a bit to investigate the root cause.

                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files
                on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user
                app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually
                setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                Setting `Delegate=yes` ensures that systemd will not change anything on
                the cgroups created for running the containers.

                This setting is used upstream since this commit:

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to
                        set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream.
                        Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so
                        that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing
                        this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch
                        by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a
                        separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that
                        encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer
                        interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting
                        code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining
                        duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that
                        almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this
                        is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest.

                        There were various usages of Bash-specific features. As
                        a result, the

                        script would work correctly only on OSes that have `sh`
                        as an alias to

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing
                        any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for
                        two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                          warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Fix the actual check. We previously used `[ $abort ]
                        && exit 1` which
                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                The patch applied to systemd addressed this upstream moby issue:
                https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/27202

                This was fixed in containerd 1.0.2:
                https://github.com/containerd/console/pull/10/commits/c358734ec94e72903243bd1c9034874a1de09424

                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in
                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and
                later.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a
                        device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to
                        "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance
                        after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify
                        secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The
                        `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so
                        this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container
                        to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often
                happens that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device
                integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the
                same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we
                use.

                        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned
                        to the preloaded

                        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned
                        release gets

                        released in the future, that would lead to the device
                        remaining in "VPN

                        only" state forever as the provisioning process could
                        not finish due to

                        pinning failure.


                        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does
                        not exist, the

                        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet
                        pinning state.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the
                        platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are
                        mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images,
                        particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf
                        built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to single-arch solves this as the
                        docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the
                        manifest. Once some

                        of the builder issues are fixed, we should move to #2141

                        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of
                        the firewall is that

                        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT
                        chain of the filter table.

                        This doesn't play well with services that add to the
                        INPUT chain on startup that

                        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain
                        NetworkManager connection

                        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL
                        rule in the INPUT chain,

                        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

              hash: 80d2c45d7318464935516acdc2dd884efaacf31a
              body: >
                In the Internet connection sharing test one of the checks may
                run

                into a racing problem. The following command is holding the
                iptables

                lock for 3 seconds while NetworkManager activates a connection
                with

                sharing enabled:


                `flock /run/xtables.lock sleep 3 & nmcli c up dummy & wait`


                NetworkManager waits for 2 seconds for the lock to be released
                and

                those three seconds should be enough for one of the iptables
                rules

                to fail. However there is no guarantee that NetworkManager will
                start

                adding the iptables rules that quickly - it may start adding
                those

                after one out of those three seconds already passed, which will

                lead to all iptables rules to be set at the end.


                This check is non-essential for the test itself, so it is
                removed with

                this commit.

                At this moment, when module signing is enabled, the peak module
                is signed

                but do_install ignores the signed variant and installs the
                original

                unsigned file. With this patch do_install installs the signed
                file

                if available.

                Previously, we bailed out of the installer when the system was
                in user

                mode (keys enrolled) but the user had not opted in to secure
                boot, as it

                was ambiguous whether the user actually wanted SB/FDE.


                However, some systems come with vendor keys pre-enrolled, and a
                user may

                simply turn off secure boot in the firmware setup menu without
                erasing

                the keys. This would result in the installer bailing out even
                though

                secure boot is disabled in the firmware menu.


                Check that secure boot is enabled in addition to having keys
                enrolled

                before bailing out.

                Test for the NetworkManager patch done in

                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/2963


                A racing condition between balenaEngine and NetworkManager led
                to some Internet

                connection sharing iptables rules not being applied when NM
                connection profile

                with Internet sharing was activated at boot.


                This test checks whether all necessary iptables rules are added
                by artificially

                blocking iptables for 1 second and then for 3 seconds while a
                connection

                profile with Internet sharing is activated.

                when it runs as it will be copying them to the actual boot
                partition.

                There is a race condition between it and grub_conf:do_deploy,

                we have seen builds fail when grub_conf:do_deploy does not
                execute

                in time. This patch adds an explicit dependency to avoid such
                situation.

                We have added DER certificates because it is the only format

                that QEMU/TianoCore accepts in UEFI setup. Since we made setup
                mode

                work properly, there is no need to program the QEMU keys
                manually

                and therefore there is no reason to pollute the boot partition
                with

                the DER files. If indeed necessary, they can always be extracted

                from the ESL, which is still shipped. Shipping the DER files is
                also

                not possible when db uses hashes instead of certificates, which
                we

                want to move towards.

                Previously, it was being referred to only as "balena". Being
                explicit

                that this is about balenaEngine makes it simpler to grep for

                Engine-related portions of balenaOS. Might also help a tad bit
                when

                looking at logs.

                When migrating, we can't assume a device can be remotely powered
                on, so

                finish the flashing with a reboot instead of a shutdown.


                This is possible as the initramfs does not currently have a
                shutdown

                command and avoids the complexity of having to detect whether we
                are

                running from initramfs or not.

                When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the
                initramfs will

                not boot into the OS but launch adbd.


                A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP
                address

                is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.


                For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and
                run:

                ```

                adb connect $IPADDR:5555

                adb shell

                ```


                Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

                There is nothing in `balena-config-vars` itself that needs
                `fatrw`, so

                change it so scripts don't exit if it is not available. For
                example,

                `balena-config-vars` gets used in the initramfs but `fatrw` is
                not

                required (and it is quite heavy).

                This allows to include only the balena-config scripts in the

                Not all device types need to support RAID, and its components
                increase

                the images size significantly.


                This commit introduces a `raid` machine feature that device
                types need

                to define if RAID support is required.

                These dependencies are already part of the corresponding
                packagegroups,

                so listing them here is redundant and wrong as it increases the

                the initramfs with no reason.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the
                Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot
                filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the
                BSP.

                Block device nodes are sometimes created without attached media.
                These

                devices can neither be read from, nor written to. In this case,
                the

                flasher will attempt to install to the invalid disk and
                fail.  Detect

                this case and skip the disk to allow flashing to continue.

                        Remove try/catch block surrounding client code that
                        blanket handles all

                        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.


                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception,
                        just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                The engine is currently versioned in such a way that upstream
                semver tags are added to branches before merging to master.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only
                consider automated GitHub Releases.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network
                        names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get
                        duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a
                        container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the
                        state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be
                        referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this
                        will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate
                        networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the
                        system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some
                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,
                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries
                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of
                        the ambiguity.

                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes
                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor
                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it
                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.

                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if
                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will
                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

              body: >
                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in
                `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If
                any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public
                key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system
                again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't
                enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result
                in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly
                opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption
                along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to
                install

                without secure boot.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the
                purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher
                with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure
                boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in
                firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot
                is

                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is
                empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64
                        using tianocore

                        firmware. Additionally, swtpm may not be available for
                        all platforms.

                        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate
                        compose file that is

                        only used when secure boot is enabled.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label
                of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev
                path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name
                under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks
                name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the
                resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                With secure boot enabled boot and EFI partition are split apart.

                During rollback-health, when bind-mounting inactive root to run

                old hooks from, the EFI partition must be bind-mounted as well

                otherwise the /mnt/boot/EFI symlink is invalid and rollback
                fails

                to deploy files into that directory.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0
                in the extra_uEnv.txt file of the flasher image and
                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started
                using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

            - subject: "networkmanager: Make iptables wait for xtables.lock"
              hash: afebbcddeebdda9e5988507a5fcf5ad93cf79cab
              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that
                happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated
                before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq
                instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by
                restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: |
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and
                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at
                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.
                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See
                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322

                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:

                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to
                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                If the signing server's response is anything other than
                successful, such

                as with an authentication failure or bad request, the HTTP
                status code

                and response are hidden due to the --silent flag passed to cURL.


                Drop the stdio redirect to the output file along with the
                --silent flag,

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and
                response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations
                that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we
                are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena
                is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code
                that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code
                that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is
                fixed upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being
                used.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM
                devices are still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen
                returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and
                cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially
                initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some
                CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression
                ratio.

                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to
                unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes
                user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system
                unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first
                place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS
                volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI
                partition).

                naming"
              hash: 795e2427821d28fcf894da1cba9afc245efc38b3
              body: >
                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different
                LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA"
                UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4"
                PARTLABEL="resin-rootA"
                PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as
                a fallback

                method to identify devices.

                isn't substituted in the compose if the variable, even if it is

              body: >
                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio
                compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in
                balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in
                kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option,
                but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD
                is also

                missing.

                Generate a bmap file from the sparse image to allow for punching
                holes

                in the disk image ranges that were unmapped after building. This
                data is

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                writing, and verifying the sparse image.

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in
                        conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have
                        to be

                        considered.

                        Instead of retrying to get the DUT IP address 120 times on a 1 seconds interval,
                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will
                        timeout too in 15 seconds:

                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162

                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to
                communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys,
                using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear
                down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth
                test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to
                authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on
                testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                There are two sets of keys used in this test, one stored in
                `/root/id`

                which is created by the cloud suite to SSH via the proxy server,
                and

                a custom key stored in `/root/test_id` used in some of the
                subtests.


                Fix the test cases using the custom key to use the correct
                private key.

                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching
                openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not
                get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the
                pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy
                step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the
                do_deploy

                step.

        This is usually created in meta-balena for
        boards that use u-boot. However, the orin
        uses UEFI L4TLauncher which is capable of
        parsing extra_uEnv.txt, so we include this
        file for it too.

        The boot0.img was generated incorrectly because the
        signed binaries were not present at that point. This caused
        failure in booting after the update. The issue was not visible
        on a local yocto setup which had multiple builds done because
        the files were already deployed from previous tegra234-flash-dry
        runs.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which
                unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit,
                openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is
                found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the
                layer.

              hash: 5fd19e26d35d7160e2531277a9a14e194d0b95c6

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in `chrony.conf`
                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony
                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start
                if that's the case.

                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens
                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and
                hitting this problem.

                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the
                start to avoid the race condition.

                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony
                does (see
                https://github.com/mlichvar/chrony/blob/7b197953e8add5515b7e58c4638dc55aa4bb91b7/conf.c#L1761)

        generated by tegraflash.
