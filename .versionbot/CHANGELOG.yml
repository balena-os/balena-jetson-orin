      body: |
        The image-maker appears to fail in staging,
        perhaps the image is too large. Let's shrink the
        partition sizes a bit to investigate the root cause.

              body: >
                Setting `LimitCORE=0` will avoid the creation of core dump files on

                containers. This will avoid cases in which a crashlooping user app ends

                up filling up the entire storage with dump files.


                Users can re-enable core dumps in their services by manually setting the

                `ulimits.core`. For example:


                ```

                services:
                  my-service:
                    ulimits:
                      core: -1
                ```


                (Where -1 is used to mean "unlimited")

                        The original delta code on the `xfer` package used to set `d.err` when

                        an unexpected EOF was found in the delta tar stream. Turns out `d.err`

                        would end up being overwritten before it was read, so that initial

                        assignment was effectively a no-op.


                        This commit simplifies the code a little bit by removing this bogus

                        assignment and also improves the error reporting a notch by adding more

                        context to the error messages.

                        This factors out portions of the `distribution` package, so that we can

                        reuse this functionality between `balena pull` and `balena load`. There

                        was a good deal of duplication.


                        This piece of code is tricky to factor out into a separate function.

                        Basically we had two options:


                        1. Create a completely reusable, DRY function that encapsulates all the
                           duplicate code. Sounds nice until you noticed that would be a
                           horrendous function with 5 return values and overly obscure
                           semantics.
                        2. We create a small set of functions with clearer interfaces and
                           semantics, but which will still lead to some code duplication between
                           the `pull` and `load` implementations.

                        I opted for the second alternative because the resulting code is much

                        easier to understand and maintain. Also, the remaining duplication is

                        mostly dumb, integration and error handling code that almost writes

                        itself as we call the new reusable functions -- so, this is sort of a

                        benign duplication.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest.

                        `bash`. It would fail on Ubuntu, for example.

                        A couple of changes here:


                        * Check for sudo necessity and availability before doing any real work.
                          Better to warn and exit quick and early!
                        * Remove the support for using `su`. It was broken for two reasons.
                          First, unlike `sudo`, `su -c` expects the command as a single
                          argument. Second, `su`, unlike `sudo`, reads the password from stdin
                          which in this case "contains" the tarball being downloaded. The second
                          point is particularly tricky to solve without saving the tarball to
                          storage (and we want to avoid extra storage space and wear). And,
                          anyway, users that can `su -c` can also `su` manually before
                          installing.

                          caused the script to always exit (`abort` is never empty).

                This fix is present in balena engine since v17.13.5, which has been in

                use since commit 53ce147. Drop this patch from meta-balena-dunfell and

                Certain services, such as getty@.service, and systemd-logind.service are

                disabled when running in a container using a patch to the source files.

                This increases the manual intervention necessary when adding support for

                a new version of systemd. Replace the patch with drop-in configs.

                        Some incoming tests require QEMU to exit, simulating a device powering

                        off, before starting QEMU again. This is used to "reflash" a virtualized

                        device before continuing with testing, for instance after tampering with

                        boot files on a secure boot enabled device to verify secure boot checks.


                        However, swtpm will exit when QEMU disconnects. The `--exit-code-from`

                        compose argument implies `--abort-on-container-exit`, so this results

                        in the test run aborting prematurely.


                        Adapt the entrypoint and command of the swtpm container to always

                        restart the program without exiting the container.

                device repos not to specify it and use Kconfig support or if for some

                reason there are boards with old u-boot versions they can overwrite the

                Because we use this patch with various u-boot versions it often happens
                that this patch

                does not apply so we then need to rework it in the device integration layer. Instead it

                would be better to have some code at configure time parsing the same file and inserting

                the balena env dynamically, so regardless of u-boot versions we use.

                        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned to the preloaded

                        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned release gets

                        released in the future, that would lead to the device remaining in "VPN

                        only" state forever as the provisioning process could not finish due to

                        pinning failure.


                        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does not exist, the

                        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet pinning state.

                        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the platform flag

                        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and single

                        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

                        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on aarch64).


                        Moving the full build to single-arch solves this as the docker engine is

                        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest. Once some

                        of the builder issues are fixed, we should move to #2141

                        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of the firewall is
                        that

                        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT chain of the filter table.

                        This doesn't play well with services that add to the INPUT chain on startup that

                        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain NetworkManager connection

                        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL rule in the INPUT chain,

                        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

              hash: 80d2c45d7318464935516acdc2dd884efaacf31a
              body: >
                In the Internet connection sharing test one of the checks may run

                into a racing problem. The following command is holding the iptables

                lock for 3 seconds while NetworkManager activates a connection with

                sharing enabled:


                `flock /run/xtables.lock sleep 3 & nmcli c up dummy & wait`


                NetworkManager waits for 2 seconds for the lock to be released and

                those three seconds should be enough for one of the iptables rules

                to fail. However there is no guarantee that NetworkManager will start

                adding the iptables rules that quickly - it may start adding those

                after one out of those three seconds already passed, which will

                lead to all iptables rules to be set at the end.


                This check is non-essential for the test itself, so it is removed with

                this commit.

                At this moment, when module signing is enabled, the peak module is signed

                but do_install ignores the signed variant and installs the original

                unsigned file. With this patch do_install installs the signed file

                if available.

                Previously, we bailed out of the installer when the system was in user

                mode (keys enrolled) but the user had not opted in to secure boot, as it

                was ambiguous whether the user actually wanted SB/FDE.


                However, some systems come with vendor keys pre-enrolled, and a user may

                simply turn off secure boot in the firmware setup menu without erasing

                the keys. This would result in the installer bailing out even though

                secure boot is disabled in the firmware menu.


                Check that secure boot is enabled in addition to having keys enrolled

                before bailing out.

                Test for the NetworkManager patch done in

                https://github.com/balena-os/meta-balena/pull/2963


                A racing condition between balenaEngine and NetworkManager led to some Internet

                connection sharing iptables rules not being applied when NM connection profile

                with Internet sharing was activated at boot.


                This test checks whether all necessary iptables rules are added by artificially

                blocking iptables for 1 second and then for 3 seconds while a connection

                profile with Internet sharing is activated.

                There is a race condition between it and grub_conf:do_deploy,

                we have seen builds fail when grub_conf:do_deploy does not execute

                We have added DER certificates because it is the only format

                that QEMU/TianoCore accepts in UEFI setup. Since we made setup mode

                work properly, there is no need to program the QEMU keys manually

                and therefore there is no reason to pollute the boot partition with

                the DER files. If indeed necessary, they can always be extracted

                from the ESL, which is still shipped. Shipping the DER files is also

                not possible when db uses hashes instead of certificates, which we

                want to move towards.

                Engine-related portions of balenaOS. Might also help a tad bit when

                looking at logs.

                When migrating, we can't assume a device can be remotely powered on, so

                finish the flashing with a reboot instead of a shutdown.


                This is possible as the initramfs does not currently have a shutdown

                command and avoids the complexity of having to detect whether we are

                running from initramfs or not.

                When `recovery` is passed in the kernel command line, the initramfs will

                not boot into the OS but launch adbd.


                A connection can then be established via the network (if a DHCP address

                is provided) or using a USB gadget connection.


                For a network connection, the client needs to install `adb` and run:

                ```

                adb connect $IPADDR:5555

                adb shell

                ```


                Other adb commands, like pull/push of files are also available.

                There is nothing in `balena-config-vars` itself that needs `fatrw`, so

                change it so scripts don't exit if it is not available. For example,

                `balena-config-vars` gets used in the initramfs but `fatrw` is not

                required (and it is quite heavy).

                These are not always required for the flasher to work, only when the

                These dependencies are already part of the corresponding packagegroups,

                so listing them here is redundant and wrong as it increases the size of

                the initramfs with no reason.

                - The Jetson TX2 NX has an eMMC and no SD-CARD slot

                - The JN30B Nano uses the eMMC module and not the SD-CARD one

                - The Radxa CM3 on RPI CM4 IOBoard as well as the Radxa zero use
                  rockchip software tools in order to put the eMMC in mass-storage mode
                - The CM4 module comes in two flavors: one with eMMC and the Lite version
                  which uses the carrier board sd-card slot to load the image. Both use the
                  same balenaOS image.
                  I switched the storage to internal for this DT because it *may* have
                  one, but this solely depends on the actual module.
                  Another consideration is that this DT can also boot from a USB stick
                  or a NVME drive connected to the mPCIE port.

                balenaOS uboot exports specific environment variables

                saving the entire uboot environment in any device specific

                partitions. This because it relies on the default environment being

                stored in the u-boot binary.


                Let's disable the saveenv command and avoid potential incorrect

                usage which may overwrite the partition table, resin-boot filesystem

                or other areas of the eMMC that may be pre-configured by the BSP.

                Block device nodes are sometimes created without attached media. These

                devices can neither be read from, nor written to. In this case, the

                flasher will attempt to install to the invalid disk and fail.  Detect

                this case and skip the disk to allow flashing to continue.

                        Remove try/catch block surrounding client code that blanket handles all

                        exceptions, and makes debugging and log messages worse.


                        When we don't have a valid way to handle an exception, just throw it.

                        The traceback is more useful than the handler.

                We don't want to try and pin to those commits so only

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates, this

                        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a container referencing a duplicate

                        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


                        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the state engine,

                        this means that even if somehow a container could be referencing a

                        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this will remove the

                        container first.


                        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate networks being

                        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the system to

                        correct the inconsistency.

                        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some

                        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,

                        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries

                        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of

                        the ambiguity.


                        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes

                        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor

                        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it

                        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.


                        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if

                        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will

                        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

                The os-helpers scripts are meant to be sourced by other scripts, not

                executed. When sourced, the shebang should be ignored.


                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a sh

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob parsing

                failures.

              hash: 73ca2d64f9bc22764694f774898db02a6c9e9825
              body: >
                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to install

                without secure boot.

                Extended globbing is not enabled by default, which makes the substring

                match for trimming leading zeroes not work. This causes SETUPMODEVAR to

                evaluate to "01", which fails comparison with the string "1", skipping

                key enrollment when secure boot is enabled. Compare using an integer

                expression instead.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        Not all platforms support secure boot, notably aarch64 using tianocore

                        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate compose file that is

                        only used when secure boot is enabled.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                If the image is not signed, the key enrollment will fail, and the

                flasher will enter a loop trying to enroll them and rebooting.


                Instead, skip the key enrollment if the image is not signed, resulting

                With secure boot enabled boot and EFI partition are split apart.

                During rollback-health, when bind-mounting inactive root to run

                old hooks from, the EFI partition must be bind-mounted as well

                otherwise the /mnt/boot/EFI symlink is invalid and rollback fails

                to deploy files into that directory.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0
                in the extra_uEnv.txt file of the flasher image and
                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                This EFI image contains the secure boot certificates and when executed it

                is supposed to load the keys into the respective secure boot slots.


                We don't use this binary in our secure boot implementation, but currently

                the build breaks as the binary is installed but not packaged.

                        The rpi3 devices in the rig seemed more reliable
                        and there are more of them.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is fixed
                upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression ratio.

              hash: f5e8488e7b87c38829d241f788413433526d2f78
              body: >
                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

                naming"
              hash: 795e2427821d28fcf894da1cba9afc245efc38b3
              body: >
                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA" UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="resin-rootA" PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as a fallback

                method to identify devices.

              body: >
                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                        This reverts commit eb69ff445fe0cac4f2060e67fa6994e61c3ca4b9.


                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        interval,

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.

                This commits works around it by allowing all members of the service's

                supervisor"
              hash: fd788120e5915820e75240e548760fd107cc0580
              body: >
                The `os-config` application stops the supervisor before fetching openvpn

                configuration and starting the `openvpn` service unit.


                As the `openvpn` service units stops `os-config`, it might not get to

                restart the supervisor.


                This commit checks that `os-config` is not already active before

                starting it.


                Fixes #2855

                The sshd daemon is configured to fetch keys from the API for local

                user connections. The script that fetches the keys, cloud-public-sshkeys,

                sources balena-config-vars and is run as an exclusive non-root user.


                Let's set the correct permissions for this file to allow not to break

                the above.


                Also, add a test to check that the SSH authentication with user

                registered keys does not break again.

                Yocto builds will abort due to inconsistencies between the pseudo

                database and files modified outside of the pseudo context [0].


                This will occasionally cause builds to fail in the do_deploy step of the

                kernel-devsrc recipe. [1]


                Fix this by not removing the kernel_source tarball in the do_deploy

                step.

        This is usually created in meta-balena for
        boards that use u-boot. However, the orin
        uses UEFI L4TLauncher which is capable of
        parsing extra_uEnv.txt, so we include this
        file for it too.

        The boot0.img was generated incorrectly because the
        signed binaries were not present at that point. This caused
        failure in booting after the update. The issue was not visible
        on a local yocto setup which had multiple builds done because
        the files were already deployed from previous tegra234-flash-dry
        runs.

                This config file hasn't been used since commit 2db88c2, which unified

                how managed and unmanaged images operate. Since that commit, openvpn

                starts up if the config file at /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf is found, and

                otherwise remains inactive. This file is populated by os-config.


                Remove the old config to prevent misdirection and cleanup the layer.

                Chronyd checks that the directory specified as `sourcedir` in
                `chrony.conf`

                (in this case `/var/chrony`) is not world accessible if it exists (chrony

                will create it correctly if it does not exist), and does not start

                if that's the case.


                The way that the `/var/chrony` is created when it does not exist opens

                the possibility of the directory existing with the wrong permissions and

                hitting this problem.


                This commit creates the directory with the correct permissions from the

                start to avoid the race condition.


                It also changes the permissiong from 750 to 770 to match what chrony

                does (see

        In this commit we cleanup the tegra234-flash-dry recipe
        and also create the 64MB signed boot blob that gets
        written to mtdblock0 during HUP, from the signed binaries
        generated by tegraflash.
