virtual/dtb packages for vendor-supplied device trees

These are meant to replace nvidia-kernel-oot-devicetrees,
which is the default option and contains the trees supplied
by Nvidia as a part of the nvidia-kernel-oot bundle.

The structure is a bit weird because it is a drop-in replacements
for nvidia's package.
