Software Disclaimer:
In addition to the hardware, Syslogic provides a basic operating system for development purposes based on Linux4Tegra (L4T) in combination with the Jetpack library from NVIDIA.
This operating system image has been slightly modified by Syslogic to ensure hardware compatibility with the installed components.
In fact, the core operating system remains the Ubuntu-based distribution provided by NVIDIA with all its features and limitations. 
The customer is responsible for the appropriate licensing, final configuration, maintenance and security of the system (e.g. adding new software packages, configuration of wireless modules including country-specific settings, etc.) as well as any middleware required for the customer application (AI). In addition, the license terms of the respective packages, libraries and NVIDIA apply.
