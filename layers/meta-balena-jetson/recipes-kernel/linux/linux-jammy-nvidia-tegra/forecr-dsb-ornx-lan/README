The device trees here come from the BSP packages found at:

Note the BSP overlays (dtbo) go to nvidia-kernel-oot instead.

DSBOARD-ORNX-LAN (but not the base DSBOARD-ORNX) uses slightly different
device trees for the kernel and the bootloader.
In the BSP, the 0_tegra_*.dtb are for the kernel, while tegra_*.dtb end
up in the bootloader. The difference between them is minor, and seems to only
affect the recovery USB port. For consistency, we stick to the BSP logic here.
